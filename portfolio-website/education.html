                <li>Identified a research gap in predicting cognitive behavioural therapy outcomes, particularly in the use of text and large language models.</li>
                <li>Employed NLP methods to extract features from referral papers, whilst hyperparameter-tuning and optimising advanced models, including LightGBM, XGBoost and BERT, achieving a maximum accuracy of 67.5%.</li>
                <li>Currently reviewing and finalising the paper for publication, which discusses the various methods applied.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Modules: Exploratory Data Analysis (96%), Project in Data Science (85%), Data Visualisation (84%), Computing (81%), Machine Learning (78%), Time Series Modelling (75%).</li>
                <li>Produced a Random Forest model achieving 70% accuracy in categorising five levels of traffic accident severity. Employed various methods like XGBoost, LSTM and GRU for comprehensive analysis, implementing rigorous cross-validation and fine-tuning to refine hyperparameters.</li>
                <li>Forecasted annual sales using 1,000,000 instances of historical data. Leveraged methods such as Seasonal ARIMA, Time Series Regression and Dynamic Linear Regression, to achieve an R-squared value of 0.99.</li>
                <li>Developed a Power BI dashboard that used key metrics to illustrate the impact of a simulated epidemic across Manchester, identifying areas needing attention and providing supporting evidence.</li>
                <li>Led 2 groups of 8, applying techniques from the course: one to comprehend water flow patterns within a household and another to propose a new navigation app, whilst also presenting findings and reports to the stakeholders.</li>

                <li>Explored logistic regression models in R by comparing numerous nested structures and identifying those optimal at classifying plant colour. However, discovered limitations in the predictive capability of the given variables, even when upon considering interactions.</li>
                <li>Integrated with a team of students to explore epidemic modelling methods, predicting daily infection rates for diseases like influenza and providing valuable insights for pandemic prevention efforts.</li>
