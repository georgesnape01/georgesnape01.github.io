        <h2>Lesson Plan</h2>
        <p>My lessons start by discussing your goals. I recommend two approaches if you are unsure: guiding you through material with practice and feedback, followed by completing similar questions together for additional support, or working independently, then reviewing any mistakes in the next session so that you can really test your applied knowledge.</p>
